"""Measure the repo's current state into `docs/metrics/` — the lean-o-meter.

The v4 goal is a system that stays small as it gains features, and the honest way to know
whether that is happening is to measure it every commit rather than to assert it. This
writes ONE small file holding only the CURRENT numbers: flash per firmware variant, tick
and FPS per target, lines of code by area, comment density, test counts, docs inventory.

**The file never grows, because the history is git's.** `git log -p docs/metrics/repo-health.json`
is the trend; the file itself is a snapshot. That is the whole design: no accumulating
log, no rolling window, no second source of truth to prune later.

**Soft ratchet, by intent.** Nothing here fails a build or blocks a commit. The gate
prints the delta against the committed file before overwriting it, so growth is visible
while you work, and the file's diff shows it again in review. The judgment stays human:
these numbers count things, they cannot tell a valuable comment from a restating one, or
a load-bearing test from a trivial one.

Every measurement is deterministic and dependency-free (git ls-files, file reads, stat),
so two machines agree and a number never moves for a reason nobody can explain.

Usage:
  uv run moondeck/check/repo_health.py            # print the snapshot + delta, write nothing
  uv run moondeck/check/repo_health.py --write    # write docs/metrics/repo-health.* (KPI gate does this)
