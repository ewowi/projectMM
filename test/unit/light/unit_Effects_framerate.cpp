// The system rule from architecture.md: **everything that changes over time is driven by elapsed
// time, never by the frame count.** An effect advanced a fixed amount per frame runs at whatever
// speed the hardware renders — the same setting is an explosion on a desktop at thousands of fps and
// a drift on an ESP32 at a few hundred. The user sets a speed; the hardware must not get a vote.
//
// This sweeps EVERY effect (the list is generated from the source tree, so a new effect is audited
// without touching this file) and renders the same span of SIMULATED time at two very different
// framerates. A time-driven effect produces a comparable amount of light either way; a
// frame-counting one does not.
//
// It measures activity rather than exact pixels on purpose: integration error, dithering and
// palette rounding all differ slightly between step sizes, and pinning exact output would fail on
// noise rather than on the bug. What cannot differ is HOW MUCH happens per second.
