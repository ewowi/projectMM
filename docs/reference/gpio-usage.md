# GPIO usage per MCU — hardware reference

Which GPIOs are safe to wire a mic, an LED strand, or an Ethernet PHY to on each MCU projectMM supports, so a bench build picks a pin from here instead of re-scraping the datasheet. This is **chip**-level (which GPIOs the silicon reserves or role-assigns); a specific product's *board* wiring is its catalog entry in [`mooninstaller/deviceModels.json`](../../mooninstaller/deviceModels.json), and the one fully-mapped board is the [ESP32-S31 coreboard](esp32-s31-coreboard.md).

Each chip lists two kinds of pin to avoid:

- **Reserved** — wired to flash / PSRAM / native USB on-silicon. Using one crashes or corrupts the device. **Never** route peripheral I/O here.
- **Role-conflict** — a usable GPIO that also carries a default role (JTAG, the UART0 console, a boot strap). Usable for I/O, but you give up that role: no hardware JTAG debug, no serial console, or a boot-mode hazard if the pin is driven during reset. Fine for a peripheral you're willing to trade the role for.

Everything else is free for user I/O. Since the ESP32 I²S / RMT / LED peripherals route through the GPIO matrix, any free GPIO works for a mic or an LED lane; there is no fixed pinout to match.

**Sources:** the per-chip Espressif datasheet (linked in each section). When picking defaults for a new chip, read its strapping-pin and flash/PSRAM tables from the datasheet first, not from a tutorial.

## Usable LED-output GPIOs per MCU (quick reference)

For **LED output** specifically — the pins a WS2812-class strand data line can attach to, which the parallel drivers (RMT / LCD_CAM / Parlio, moving to 1..16 lanes) draw their lanes from. This is stricter than "any free I/O" in one way: **an LED output needs a real output driver, so input-only pins are excluded** (a mic input line can use them, an LED cannot). It excludes flash/PSRAM (reserved), input-only, and — for a clean *default* — the strapping pins (usable, but a wrong reset level is a boot hazard). The per-chip tables below give the full reasoning; this is the distilled "safe to drive an LED here" set.

| MCU | Usable LED-output GPIOs (avoid straps for defaults) | Count | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|-------|
| **ESP32 (classic)** | 4, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33 | 13 | +16, 17 on **non-PSRAM** WROOM (they're PSRAM bus on WROVER). Input-only 34-39 are mic-input only, not LED. |
| **ESP32-S3 (N16R8 / octal-PSRAM)** | 1-18, 21, 47, 48 → the clean 16 for LED lanes: **4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,21** | 16 | Excludes octal-PSRAM (33-37), USB (19,20), UART0 (43,44), onboard RGB LED (38 on rev v1.0 / 48 on rev v1.1 — avoid whichever your board uses), straps (0,3,45,46). Quad-PSRAM (N8R2) / no-PSRAM parts free 33-37 too. |
| **ESP32-P4 (P4-NANO)** | 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32, 33, 39-48 | 20 | Board-specific: the NANO commits eth-RMII (28-31/49-52), C6-SDIO (14-19/54), I2C (7-8), UART0 (37-38). A carrier board changes the exposed set — the MHC-WLED shield routes through transceivers (no bare GPIO). |
| **ESP32-S31 (coreboard)** | take from the [coreboard reference](esp32-s31-coreboard.md) free set | — | Most of the header is committed to on-board RGMII eth + ES8311 codec + SD + USB-host; don't guess. |

**Mapping these to actual device-model defaults** (which of a board's usable pins to pre-fill in `deviceModels.json`) is a separate, per-board step — the catalog defaults one strip for a bare dev board (the user wires the rest), or the exact wired set for a purpose-built board (QuinLED Dig-Octa: `0,1,2,3,4,5,12,13`). That per-model work is tracked in [backlog-core § LED output pins](../backlog/backlog-core.md).

## ESP32 (classic)

[Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32_datasheet_en.pdf). 34 GPIOs, but several are input-only or strapping.

| Avoid | GPIOs | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Reserved | **6-11** | SPI flash (the on-package flash bus). Always off-limits. |
| Reserved | **16, 17** | Extra flash/PSRAM bus on WROVER (PSRAM) modules; free on plain WROOM. |
| Package | **PICO-V3-02: 9, 10 reserved; 16, 17, 18, 23 absent** | The system-in-package part on the QuinLED Dig-Next-2 wires its PSRAM to 9/10 and has no pads for 16/17/18/23 (datasheet Table 7); routing a peripheral onto an absent pad wedges the flash cache with no panic. 7/8 are free on it. The firmware reads the package from eFuse and refuses these by name. |
| Package | **PICO-D4: 6-11, 16, 17 reserved** | In-package flash on all of them, PSRAM or not. |
| Role-conflict | **0, 2, 5, 12, 15** | Boot straps. Usable, but a wrong level at reset changes boot mode (GPIO 12 = flash voltage is the dangerous one). Don't drive during boot. |
| Input-only | **34, 35, 36, 39** | No output driver and no internal pull-ups. Fine for a mic **SD/SCK/WS input**, useless for an LED output. |

**Clear for output I/O:** 4, 13, 14, 18, 19, 21-23, 25-27, 32, 33 (plus 16/17 on non-PSRAM; minus 18/23 on a PICO-V3-02). Input-only 34-39 suit mic data lines, and 36 is where the classic i80 driver sinks an unset WR line.

**i80 parallel LED lanes (classic ESP32 = I2S backend).** The classic ESP32 runs the parallel LED driver over the **I2S peripheral in i80 mode** (the S3/P4 use LCD_CAM for the same i80 API; one driver, chip-picked backend). The bus is 8 or 16 bits wide but the **pin count is free** (spare lanes park on WR), and the two bus-control lines (`clockPin` = WR, `dcPin` = DC) are ignored by the LEDs. **WR is unset by default** on the classic (the platform sinks it onto an input-only pad, so it costs no GPIO); set it only for a '595 expander that needs it as a shift clock. **DC always needs a real output pin** (default 33): `esp_lcd` toggles it in software every frame, which a pad without an output driver cannot do. The bus is an **I2S peripheral** and always drives from **instance 1**, leaving instance 0 for audio: only instance 0 has the PDM converter, and nothing needs instance 1, so a microphone (PDM or standard), a line-in ADC and parallel LEDs all run together. Bench-verified on the ESP32-WROVER (`/dev/cu.usbserial-0001`):

- **8 lanes:** data `2,4,13,14,18,19,21,22`, WR unset, DC `33`. (Pin 2 is a boot strap: it drives an LED fine and idles LOW, so it is benign here, but the Pins UI flags it; swap it for `23` to silence the warning.)
- **16 lanes: not cleanly reachable on the WROVER.** Only 13 non-strap output pins exist, and WR/DC consume 2 more, so a 16-lane set must borrow strap pins (0, 12, 15) — and **GPIO 12 is the flash-voltage strap: driving it at reset can brick the boot**, so don't. Use a board with more free GPIOs (an S3/P4) for 16 lanes; the classic ESP32 is an 8-lane i80 board in practice.
- **Memory ceiling: 2048 lights at 8 lanes** (measured on the WROVER, 2026-07-13; 8×256 drives, 8×384 already fails). The I2S backend can't DMA from PSRAM, so its frame buffer is internal-RAM-only (~76 KB largest block) — an over-ceiling config degrades with `i80 bus init failed — check pins / memory`, it does not crash. Neither shrinking the grid (that memory is PSRAM) nor turning `doubleBuffer` off (one DMA buffer instead of two) raises it. See [performance.md § Multi-pin LED driving](../performance.md#multi-pin-led-driving-all-three-peripherals-128128-grid).

## ESP32-S3

[Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-s3_datasheet_en.pdf). 45 GPIOs. The reserved set **depends on the module's PSRAM**, which is the trap.

| Avoid | GPIOs | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Reserved | **26-32** | SPI flash bus. Always off-limits. |
| Reserved (**octal-PSRAM only, the N16R8 / R8 modules**) | **33-37** | Octal PSRAM's SPIIO4-7 + DQS. On an R8 module these are **not** GPIOs; using one corrupts PSRAM. On quad-PSRAM (N8R2) or no-PSRAM parts they are free. Check the module suffix. |
| Role-conflict | **39, 40, 41, 42** | JTAG (MTCK/MTDO/MTDI/MTMS). Usable as GPIO, but you lose hardware JTAG debug. Keep free if you plan to add JTAG. |
| Role-conflict | **19, 20** | Native USB D-/D+ (the USB-C port on DevKitC boards). Usable, but breaks the native-USB console/DFU. |
| Role-conflict | **43, 44** | UART0 TX/RX — the default serial console. Take them and you lose `printf`-over-serial. |
| Role-conflict | **0, 45, 46** | Boot straps. Don't drive at reset. |
| Absent | **22, 23, 24, 25** | These GPIO numbers **do not exist** on the S3 (a numbering gap in the silicon). Setting a pin control to one is invalid — `GPIO_IS_VALID_GPIO` rejects it, and the pin map flags it as an error. |

**Clear for I/O on the N16R8:** 1-18, 21, 47, 48 (mind GPIO 3 is a soft strap; the on-board WS2812 LED sits on **48** on DevKitC-1 rev v1.1 but on **38** on rev v1.0, so avoid whichever your board uses — the bench board is a rev v1.0, LED on 38, leaving 48 free). Example, the bench mic on the N16R8 is **SCK=47 / WS=48 / SD=21** — clear of octal PSRAM, JTAG (39-42 stay free for a future JTAG probe), the boot straps, and (on this rev) the LED, with the mic wires kept away from the Wi-Fi antenna end.
## ESP32-P4

[Datasheet](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-p4_datasheet_en.pdf). 55 GPIOs, RISC-V. The P4 has **no native radio**; WiFi rides an on-board ESP32-C6 over SDIO, so several pins carry that link.

| Avoid | GPIOs | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Reserved | **flash/PSRAM pins per module** | The HP SPI flash + PSRAM bus (module-specific; the Waveshare P4-NANO wires them internally). Off-limits. |
| Role-conflict | **34-38** | Strapping pins (boot mode). Don't drive at reset; the first LED-driver default wrongly landed here (see [lessons.md](../history/lessons.md)). |
| Role-conflict | **37, 38** | UART0 console on the P4-NANO (`CONFIG_ESP_CONSOLE_UART_DEFAULT`) — the runtime `ESP_LOGI` lines come out here, not over USB. |
| Board-wired (P4-NANO) | **Ethernet RMII** 28-31 / 49-52, **C6 SDIO** 14-19 / 54, **I2C** 7-8 | Consumed by the NANO's on-board Ethernet PHY, the C6 WiFi co-processor, and the I2C bus. |

**Clear on the P4-NANO:** 20-27, 32-33, 39-48 (the LED-driver default is `pins="20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27"`). Exact free set is board-specific; the NANO's is the reference. A carrier board changes what's exposed and how — the [MHC-WLED ESP32-P4 shield](mhc-wled-esp32-p4-shield.md) routes every terminal through level shifters / RS-485 transceivers / protected inputs (no bare GPIO), which is why a direct loopback jumper fails on it; its full terminal map is on that page.

## ESP32-S31

[Datasheet](https://documentation.espressif.com/esp32-s31_datasheet_en.pdf). RISC-V, Wi-Fi 6 + on-chip 1 Gbps EMAC; shares the MoonLive RISC-V backend with the P4. The bench board's full schematic pin map (Ethernet RGMII, ES8311 audio codec, SD, USB-host) is on its own page: [ESP32-S31 coreboard](esp32-s31-coreboard.md).

| Avoid | GPIOs | Why |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Reserved | flash/PSRAM per module | On-package flash + PSRAM bus. Off-limits. |
| Board-wired (coreboard) | **RGMII Ethernet** + **ES8311 I2S/I2C** + **SD** + **USB-host** | The Function-CoreBoard-1 uses a large set for its on-board peripherals — see the [coreboard reference](esp32-s31-coreboard.md) for the exact map, since the audio codec (not a bare I²S mic) drives its own pins. |

For the S31 coreboard, take pins from the coreboard reference's "free" set rather than guessing, because so much of the header is committed to on-board peripherals.

## The rule behind the defaults

projectMM leaves peripheral pins **unset** by default and lets the deviceModel catalog fix them only where the *product* wires them (the [Defaults rule](../coding-standards.md#defaults)): a board-soldered PHY or codec defaults its pins; a user-soldered mic or LED strand stays unset so a guess can't drive a pin the user committed elsewhere. This table is what to consult when choosing that user pin, or when writing a new board's catalog entry.
